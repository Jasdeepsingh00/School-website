                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> In a day, a child spends one fourth of his time in school and three fourths of his time with his parents. Understanding this fact, parents should never think that by sending their ward to a good school, they have got rid of their responsibilities. The parents and the teachers work in partnership for the all-round development of a child. It is important to teach students to respect school discipline and be proud of it.
